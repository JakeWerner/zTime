Privacy Policy for zTime

Effective Date: May 1, 2025

Thank you for using zTime. This Privacy Policy explains what information zTime collects and how it's used. Your privacy is important to us.

1. Information We Collect

zTime is designed to function with minimal data collection. The app collects and stores the following information only locally on your device:

App Preferences: This includes settings you choose within the app, such as:
Selected Theme Mode (Light, Dark, or System Default)
Selected Accent Color
Preference for Local Time Source (Automatic device setting or Manual selection)
The specific time zone ID you select if using the "Manual" local time source setting.
The list of location IDs you add to the World Clock screen.
Terms Acceptance: A flag indicating whether you have agreed to the app's Legal Notice & Disclaimer upon first launch.
We DO NOT Collect:

Personally Identifiable Information (PII): zTime does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information that could directly identify you, such as your name, email address, phone number, precise geographic location, contacts, or photos.
Usage Analytics (Currently): As of the effective date of this policy, zTime does not include third-party analytics tools to track detailed usage patterns. Basic, anonymous crash reporting might be handled by the underlying operating system (Android/iOS) according to their policies.
Advertising Data: zTime does not include any advertising networks and does not collect any data for advertising purposes.
2. How We Use Information

The information stored locally on your device (your preferences) is used solely to:

Remember your settings between app sessions (e.g., keep your chosen theme, color, and world clock locations).
Ensure the local time display functions according to your "Automatic" or "Manual" preference.
Prevent the legal notice from showing after you have agreed to it once.
3. Data Storage

All the preference data mentioned above is stored locally on your device using Flutter's standard SharedPreferences functionality. This data typically remains on your device until the app is uninstalled, or until you clear the app's data/cache through your device's system settings.

4. Data Sharing

We do not share any information collected or stored by the app with any third parties.

Donation Links: The "Support the Dev" feature contains links that will open external websites (e.g., Buy Me a Coffee, PayPal) in your device's web browser. Your interaction with those external sites is governed entirely by their respective privacy policies and terms of service. zTime does not transmit any data to these sites when you click the link.
5. User Choices

You can typically clear the app's locally stored data (including saved preferences) by using the "Clear Data" or "Clear Cache" options within your device's Application settings for zTime.

6. Children's Privacy

zTime is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age of consent in your region). We do not knowingly collect any information from children.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the app after changes signifies your acceptance of the revised policy.
